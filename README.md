# ESP8266-RaspberryPi-MQTT-NodeRED
ESP8266 MQTT Sensors to Raspberry Pi dashboard using NodeRED

I built a dashboard with a Raspberry Pi to display sensors data. The Raspberry Pi has a screen. The dashboard is powered by NodeRED and displayed on Chromium in Kiosk node.
The Raspberry Pi is setup as a WiFi access point so that the ESP8266 sensors can communicate directly to the Raspberry Pi through WiFi in MQTT.

## Requirements

### Hardware
* At least one ESP8266 board (I am using Wemos D1 Mini)
* At least one sensor connected to a ESP8266 board (I am using Wemos SHT30 shield)
* One Raspberry Pi (model 3 is prefered)
* A LCD screen for the Raspberry Pi (I am using a 3.5 Inches LCD touch screen)


### Software
* Arduino IDE (on computer for ESP8266 development)
* Program in .ino from this repo to flash on ESP8266 
* Raspbian Jessie (on Raspberry Pi)
* MQTT Broker (I have Mosquitto: https://mosquitto.org/download/ installed on the Raspberry Pi)
